# Neural-Network
Machine-Learning/Neural-Network program that takes binary arrays and classifies them as L or H

To run this program, go to the root directory of this repository in your terminal and type:
	
	python main.py

Also a json file will be generated when you run this program called letters.json which store
the data catagorizing which array is H and which is L.

Keep in mind this program relies on randomly generated and shuffled data meaning the accuracy of the
neural network will change for each run.This program will test a neural network a certain amount of times printing
the results for each run including the accuracy, the testing arrays, etc. Afterwards the average accuracy for all these test runs will be calculated.
