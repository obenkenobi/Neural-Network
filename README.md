# Neural-Network
Machine-Learning/Neural-Network program that takes binary arrays and classifies them as L or H

To run this program, type:
	
	python main.py

Also a json file will be generated when you run this program called letters.json which store
the data catagorizing which array is H and which is L.

Keep in mind this program relies on randomly generated and shuffled data meaning the accuracy of the
neural network will change for each run. On average the accuracy will be above 90%.
